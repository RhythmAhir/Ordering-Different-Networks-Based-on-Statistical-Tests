The main purpose of the research team is to find the differences, hypothesize the causes and rank different networks according to their properties based on statistical tests. The Internet network is built by the forces of regional politics, money, business opportunities, geography etc. The Facebook graph, on the other hand, is built by the force of friendship.

In this research, the research team tried to figure out a common pattern among the different networks so that we can identify the type of network.

Analysis of different kind of social network graph can enable us to gain valuable insights into how these networks are organized. How the networks are created and how the factors of the social networks are working among different social networks, are analyzed here.

The research team began the analysis by constructing a random graph and finding different factors (e.g. Degree, eigenvalue, page rank, betweenness etc. Then the research team worked on different social networks such as Facebook network, AS network, Google network, Twitter network, Amazon network, Communication network (Email- enron), Crime network etc. The research team found out the same factors for these networks and tried to find out a pattern among the factors of network which will help the research team to identify an anonymous type of social network graph.
